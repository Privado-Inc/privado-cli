# privado-cli  

This repository is a fork of [Privado-Inc/privado](https://github.com/Privado-Inc/privado), where it is migrated to interface the images powered by the new scan engine [privado-core](https://github.com/Privado-Inc/privado-core) which not only discovers data-elements, PIIs, and third-parties but help discover in-depth dataflows from code to external sinks such as Databases, Third Parties, APIs, and help find data leakages such as logs.
